Mostly-portable repository containing personal configuration files.

* Planned improvements

** Emacs
- (Continuously) configure and install packages
- Optimize usage of ~use-package~ keywords (e.g. ~:hook~,
  ~:defines~/~:functions~, ~:pin~, etc.)
- Eliminate bytecomp warnings on initial bootstrap
- Split ~init.el~ into separate modules controlled by feature flags
- Work out when to ~setq~ variables and when to use
  ~custom-set-variables~

** Vim
- Make the configuration portable; the theme is referenced in .vimrc
  but not included in this repository
- Use a package manager
