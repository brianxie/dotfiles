Mostly-portable repository containing personal configuration files.

* Tracker

** Emacs
- Fix ~init.el~ for 27.1 changes, e.g. the addition of ~early-init.el~
- Optimize usage of ~use-package~ keywords (e.g. ~:hook~, ~:defines~
  and ~:functions~, ~:pin~, etc.)
- Eliminate bytecomp warnings on initial bootstrap
- Split ~init.el~ into separate modules controlled by feature flags

** Vim
- Make the configuration portable; the theme is referenced in .vimrc
  but not included in this repository
- Use a package manager
